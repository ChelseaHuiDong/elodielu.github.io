			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>I am pursing MS in Business Analytics(STEM program) at Carlson School of Management, University of Minnesota and will graduate in May 2018. </p>
			Prior this journey, I obtained another graduate degree in EDHEC Business School, Nice France. I had my study in International Accounting and Finance. One amazing year in Paradise! The sea is the definition of Azure, no filtered pic shown as above~ </p>
			Similarly, my undergraduate study also focused in Accounting. During those years, I also passed all CPA Canada examinations.</p>
